#### Exercise 2.11
##### Part (a)
```{r 2.11a}
w = rnorm(500)
r = acf1(w, 20, main="Sample ACF of simulated series of 500 white noise observations") #sample ACF w/ lag 20
```

We know that the actual ACF for a white noise series is $\rho(h) = \begin{cases} \sigma_w^2 \quad h = 0 \\ 0 \quad h \ne 0 \end{cases}$. 

Although the sample ACF deviates from this, this is expected. Furthermore, we can see that they remain within the error bounds for the most part.

##### Part (b)
```{r 2.11b}
w = rnorm(50)
r = acf1(w, 20, main="Sample ACF of simulated series of 50 white noise observations")
```

#### Exercise 2.12

#### Part (a)
```{r 2.12a}
par(mfrow=2:1)
w = rnorm(500)
v = filter(w, sides=2, filter=rep(1/3,3)) #MA
tsplot(v)
acf1(v, 20)
```
