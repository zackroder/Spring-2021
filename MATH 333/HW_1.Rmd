```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

#### Exercise 1
Done :D

#### Exercise 2
Installed ```xts``` and ```zoo``` packages.
```{r}
library(xts)
library(zoo)
```

#### Exercise 3
Installed package ```astsa```
```{R}
library(astsa)
```

#### Exercise 4
```{R}
(1:20/10) %% 1
```
This generates the sequence of numbers 1 through 20, divides each by 10, then does modulus division on each by 1.

#### Exercise 5
Verifying: $$1/i = -i$$
```{R}
1/1i
```

#### Exercise 6
Verifying: $$e^{i\pi} = -1$$
```{R}
exp(1i*pi)
```

#### Exercise 7
```{R}
cos(pi*1:4/2)
```

#### Exercise 8
```0 = x = y``` actually generates an error, while the following assigns 0 to both ```x``` and ```y```.
```{R}
0 -> x -> y; x; y
```

#### Exercise 9
```{R}
y = c(2,4); z = c(8,3,2)
```
If we try to add ```y``` to ```z```, we see R's recycling rule for arithmetic. We expect the vector (10, 7, 4) because of the mismatched sizes of the vectors. R adds the first element of y to z.
```{R}
y + z
```

#### Exercise 10
Writing ```cpg``` data file to "zzz.txt".
```{R}
#help(cpg)
write(cpg, file="zzz.txt", ncolumns = 1)
```

#### Exercise 11
Done!

#### Exercise 12
Scanning the data in the file "zzz.txt".
```{R}
(dummy = scan("zzz.txt"))
```

#### Exercise 13
Creating sequence ```a``` with odd numbers and ```b``` with even numbers. Then, column-binding the two into an object ```x```.
```{R}
a = seq(1,10, by=2)
b = seq(2, 10, by=2)
x = cbind(a,b)
x
x[,1]
```

#### Exercise 14
Generating 100 standard normals and drawing a boxplot of the results.
```{R}
options(digits=3)
set.seed(911)
boxplot(rnorm(100))
```

#### Exercise 15
Writing a function that takes two numbers, ```x``` and ```y``` and returns ```x``` raised to the power of ```y```.
```{R}
pwr <- function(x,y){x^y}
pwr(5,2)
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
